    I remember seeing you for the first time.
    Zach said you were super cool and that was an understatment
    I never connected with someone so quick
    I never fell for someone so quick
    I loved all the talks and all the ways we laughed
    I told Zach how much i like you and that if I could date you then i would be so happy
    I really really like you and i can't type how i feel but hopefully this shows you.
    hopefully this surprise doesn't kill you lol
